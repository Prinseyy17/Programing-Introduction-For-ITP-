Exercise 1 - Coding is Cool
Objective:
Learn about string concatenation and variables in Python.

Description:
This exercise involves filling in missing parts of the code to print the phrase "Coding is Cool" by using string concatenation. You will work with variables and the + operator to combine strings.

Exercise 2 - Simple Sums
Objective:
Understand how to use integers and perform basic arithmetic operations.

Description:
You will declare two integer variables, perform addition, and print the result. This exercise teaches how to perform simple arithmetic operations and output results in Python.

Exercise 3 - Biography
Objective:
Learn to work with dictionaries to store and retrieve data.

Description:
In this exercise, you'll create a program that stores your name, hometown, and age in a dictionary and prints these values. You'll also explore handling user input to fill in the dictionary.

Exercise 4 - Primitive Quiz About Countries
Objective:
Understand the usage of conditional statements and user input validation.

Description:
The exercise will ask the user a question about the capital of various countries. If the user's input is correct, it prints "Correct!". Otherwise, it informs the user of the correct answer. The goal is to practice if-else conditions and comparison operators.

Exercise 5 - Days of the Month
Objective:
Learn how to use dictionaries and conditional logic.

Description:
This exercise allows you to calculate the number of days in a given month by using a dictionary. You'll also learn how to handle special cases, such as leap years, using if-else statements.

Exercise 6 - Brute Force Attack
Objective:
Understand while loops and how to limit attempts for input validation.

Description:
In this exercise, you will simulate a password check system. The program will allow the user up to 5 attempts to enter the correct password. After the maximum attempts, it will print a message notifying the user that the authorities have been alerted.

Exercise 7 - Some Counting
Objective:
Learn about loops (for and while loops) and working with ranges.

Description:
In this exercise, you'll use for loops to count in different directions and with various increments. You'll print numbers starting from 0 to 50, counting backward, and more, to practice using loops with different ranges.

Exercise 8 - Simple Search
Objective:
Practice searching through lists and user input.

Description:
You will write a program to search for a name in a predefined list. If the name is found, it prints a success message. If not, it asks the user to try again, demonstrating how to handle lists and user input.

Exercise 9 - Hello
Objective:
Learn about functions in Python.

Description:
This exercise will have you create a simple function that prints "Hello" when called. You will also learn how to structure a Python program with a main() function.

Exercise 10 - Is it Even?
Objective:
Work with user input, conditional statements, and functions.

Description:
In this exercise, the user will input a number, and the program will determine if it is even or odd using a function. It will return the appropriate result and demonstrate the use of functions for input processing.
